                        Ryan is just a kid who believes that creation is the most powerful asset a person can have— He hails from Wayside, NJ, only a few minutes from the Atlantic. In this wonderful town he developed a fondness for photography and technology as an entity. Fast forward to present day and he's studying computer science at Montclair State University. Everyone eventually finds something they have a passion for and his current fixation is web development. He has a love for learning new things and determination to master things he loves.

                       PrimoVenture was created as a class project, many hours of learning html, css, javascript, and php went into the making of this website. Although this was made for a class project, Ryan sees it as a project for the future; he learned many new things on the journey throughout this project that he hopes to use in the future. About Ryan himself— an unknown fact about him is his mild addiction to chipotle; he says that it isn't a problem. Traveling is something Ryan has always wanted to do and one day hopes to visit New Zealand, Hong Kong, and Sweden. He also hopes to one day bring back the peanut butter and fluff sandwich.
